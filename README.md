## Overview

Omnifood is a modern, fully responsive landing page for a fictional healthy meal delivery service.  
This project was built to practice techniques from the **"Build Responsive Real-World Websites with HTML and CSS"** course by [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://codingheroes.io/).  
It focuses on a mobile-first responsive layout, advanced CSS (including Flexbox & CSS Grid), animations, and a clean project structure.
